move code into loki folder

expose expander and standard libraries that can be expanded during compile time (and cached, separate compilation) to act as libraries to link against thing being compiled

if program includes ex:repl or ex:expand-file, program will automatically include compiler itself in the result.

this means I need to move the emitted ex:register-macro! and other runtime usages into an expanded version that references the in-memory runtime library
